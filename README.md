# eCommerce Website Project

This project was set in my university as a solo project, where I was expected to produce an eCommerce website that sells a range of products of my choosing. The main goal of the project was to provide a list of available items in different categories and display some data from the database back-end. The users had to be able to register and login onto the website.

# Challenges Faced

As a front-end developer, the project was challenging because I was mostly familiar coding on the front-end, instead of the backend and I had never coded using PHP. To complete the project, I needed to be determined to learn through courses to gain knowledge. I also had to learn SQL in order to create the database that would be used to store the data that would be later used throughout the website using PHP.

# Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- PHP
- SQL

# Features Implemented
User registration and login
Display of products in different categories
Display of data from the database back-end
Shopping cart functionality

For the future

After reflection on how I could improve the project, I can improve the website further by implementing additional features like payment integration, order tracking, and user reviews.

# Conclusion
Overall, this project was a great opportunity for me to showcase my front-end development skills while learning new backend technologies. The end result is a fully functional eCommerce website that I am proud of.
